This error occurs when using the `expo install` command to install a package that has native modules. The error message might vary, but it generally indicates that the installation process failed due to an issue with the native modules.  Here's an example:
```
Error: Something went wrong during the install process.  See logs for more information.  Your project may be in a bad state.  Try running `expo prebuild` or `expo start --reset-cache` before attempting to install again.
