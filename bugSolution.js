To fix this error, try the following:

1. **Run `expo prebuild`:** This command prepares the native modules for your project.  Run this command in your project's root directory.

2. **Reset the cache:** If `expo prebuild` doesn't resolve the issue, try resetting the Expo cache. Run `expo start --reset-cache` in your project's root directory.  This will clear any potentially corrupted cache files that might be interfering with the installation.

3. **Clean and reinstall:**  If all else fails, try to clean your project and then reinstall the package.  You can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`) file. Then, run `expo install <package-name>` again.

Here's an example of a `package.json` file that might cause this error (if it has native modules and isn't properly set up):
```json
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "0.71.8",
    "expo": "~49.0.12",
    "react-native-camera": "^4.3.0" // Example package with native modules
  }
}
```
